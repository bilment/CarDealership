# Project Title

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Management System is a simple Java program that helps manage a car dealerships inventory. 
Users can add new cars, view all available cars, and search for cars by make like Honda or Ford. 
This program uses a CSV file to store all car information, so it’s easy to update and retrieve car details.


## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a dealership manager, I want to add new cars to the inventory so that the list of cars stays current.
- As a salesperson, I want to search for cars by make so that I can find cars that match customer needs quickly.
- As a dealership employee, I want to see all cars in the inventory so that I can help customers find options.
 -As a developer, I want the program to handle errors smoothly so that it runs without issues, even if there’s incorrect data.
